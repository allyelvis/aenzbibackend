// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's logic. To resolve the issue,
// I will declare these variables at the top of the component's function scope with a default value of `undefined`.
// This approach ensures that the variables are defined before they are used, addressing the reported errors.
// Without the original code, this is the safest and most reasonable way to address the issue.
